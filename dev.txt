MVP (MAIN GOALS)
ROUTES 

As any user when browsing the app, I want to
  X-click links/tabs that display different parts of the app.
  X-see the route I am visiting in the url bar (i.e. Routines tab should have a route https://example.com/routines)
  X-stay on the "same page", while seeing the content update (i.e. use React Router, no page refresh)
  X-see Components/Tabs with corresponding routes:
        X-Home
        X-Routines
        X-My Routines
        X-Activities
        X-Login/Register (optional. Could be alternatively created as a modal or part of the header/footer)
